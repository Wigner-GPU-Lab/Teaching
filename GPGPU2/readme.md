#Notes on the GPGPU2 sample codes

This folder contains sample code presented and discussed during the second semester [lectures on Science Targeted Programming of Graphical Processors](http://gpu.wigner.mta.hu/hu/laboratory/teaching/science-targeted-programming-of-graphical-processors-2) (in Hungarian). The content is targeted at illustrating category theoretical and functional programming concepts in modern C++ (14, 17) in some cases on the GPU via CUDA and SYCL.

Below are link and comments on the sample codes in the order they appear in the lectures.

1. Type level list manipulation in C++ [type_list.cpp](https://github.com/Wigner-GPU-Lab/Teaching/blob/master/GPGPU2/type_list.cpp)

2. Functor, Applicative and Monad concepts in C++ [functorapplicativemonad.cpp](https://github.com/Wigner-GPU-Lab/Teaching/blob/master/GPGPU2/functorapplicativemonad.cpp)
